;This program reads which dip switch is ON (from right to left, decimal number)
;and flashes the output bit of the same number, but in binary form.

;This example is the first exercise of the first set from 2019.

START:	
	MVI C,08H 	;C<--08H
	LDA 2000H	;read input from dip switches
	
JUMP1:
	RAL		;rotate bits of A left by one
	JC JUMP2	;if Carry flag is SET (CY = 1) jump to JUMP1
	DCR C		;C--
	JNZ JUMP1	;if not zero jump JUMP2
	
JUMP2:
	MOV A,C
	CMA		;A-->A complementary 
			;because of complementary output logic
			;means that output byte is converted by
			;its hardware
	STA 3000H	;print register A

;This program flashes the output LEDs (address 3000H) when the MSB of the dip switch input 
;(address 2000H) goes from OFF to ON and OFF again (push button). The output is ON for 30 secs
;and then OFF. But if, before 30 secs are down, I push the button again the timer resets to 30 secs
;again.
;Note that the system's time accuracy is bigger than 1/5 sec.

;This example is the second exercise of the second set from 2019.

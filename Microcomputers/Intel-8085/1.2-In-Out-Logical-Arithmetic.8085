;This program flashes the LSB of the output byte in memory
;3000H and then if the MSB of the input byte (memory address 
;2000H) from the dip switches is OFF rotate the light bit
;left by one each 500msec. If the MSB is ON rotate it right.
;If the LSB of the input is ON stop rotating. 
;If the LSB of the input becomes OFF again, continue. 

;This example is the second exercise of the first set from 2019.
